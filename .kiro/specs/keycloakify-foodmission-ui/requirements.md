# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves setting up a Keycloakify project to customize the Keycloak authentication UI for the FOODMISSION project, a EU-funded citizen science initiative focused on healthy food consumption and food waste reduction. The customization will provide a modern, cohesive user experience that aligns with the project's existing applications, utilizing shadcn/ui components for consistency across the platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a FOODMISSION project user, I want a modern and visually appealing authentication interface, so that my login experience feels integrated with the main application ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Keycloak login page THEN the system SHALL display a modern UI that matches the FOODMISSION project branding
2. WHEN a user interacts with form elements THEN the system SHALL use shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
3. WHEN a user views the authentication pages THEN the system SHALL present a cohesive visual design that reflects the citizen science project's mission

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a Keycloakify project structure, so that I can customize Keycloak themes efficiently and maintainably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL initialize a proper Keycloakify project structure with necessary dependencies
2. WHEN configuring the build process THEN the system SHALL support theme compilation and deployment to Keycloak
3. WHEN developing themes THEN the system SHALL provide hot-reload capabilities for efficient development workflow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate shadcn/ui components into the Keycloak theme, so that the authentication UI maintains consistency with other FOODMISSION applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing UI components THEN the system SHALL use shadcn/ui components where applicable
2. WHEN styling form elements THEN the system SHALL apply consistent design tokens and styling patterns
3. WHEN building the theme THEN the system SHALL properly bundle shadcn/ui dependencies for Keycloak compatibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a FOODMISSION project administrator, I want the authentication pages to reflect the project's identity, so that users understand they are accessing official project resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access authentication pages THEN the system SHALL display FOODMISSION project branding and messaging
2. WHEN presenting the login interface THEN the system SHALL include relevant context about the citizen science project
3. WHEN users complete authentication THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation back to the main application

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a FOODMISSION project user, I want to be able to update my password when required by the system, so that I can maintain secure access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system requires a password update THEN the user SHALL be presented with a password update form using consistent FOODMISSION branding
2. WHEN a user submits a new password THEN the system SHALL validate the password meets security requirements and provide clear feedback
3. WHEN a user successfully updates their password THEN the system SHALL confirm the change and redirect them to continue their authentication flow
4. WHEN a user encounters errors during password update THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Keycloakify theme to be deployable and configurable, so that it can be easily integrated into the existing Keycloak infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the theme THEN the system SHALL generate deployable JAR files compatible with Keycloak
2. WHEN configuring the theme THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific customizations
3. WHEN deploying the theme THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for installation and configuration
